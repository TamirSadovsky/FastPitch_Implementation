Our dataset and model checkpoint are in our Google drive. We have shared the relevant folders with you. Please follow these short steps:

1. Go to the "Shared with me" section in Google Drive.
2. Look for the folders named "LJSpeech-1.1" and "Deep Audio".
3. For each, right-click on the folder, then select 'Organize' -> 'Create shortcut' -> 'My Drive'.
4. Once you've added the folder to your Google Drive, proceed to run the next steps in the Colab notebook.
